This is React Project in which when a user hover over a button it shows tooltip. 
The position of tooltip is passed through props. 
The component will receive the ‘position‘ of tooltip as prop. We can pass options : “top”, “bottom”, “right”, “left”. According to the position the tooltip will render at that position.
